# Diabetes-and-Heart-Disease-Prediction
A Python-based project that predict the disease using machine learning. Includes Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, model training, evaluation and visualization. 
This project is a machine learning-based health prediction system that detects the risk of diabetes and heart disease using input from user medical data. It uses trained classification models to help predict the disease in both datasets.

#Features
Heart Dataset:
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14. heart disease: 0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease.

Diabetes Dataset:
1. Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. BMI: Body Mass Index = weight (kg) / heightÂ² (mÂ²)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Higher values = higher genetic risk.
8. Age
9. Outcome: 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not Diabetic.
